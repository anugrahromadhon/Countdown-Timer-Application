# Countdown Timer Application

This repository contains two Python-based countdown timer applications. The first is a terminal-based implementation, and the second provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter`.

## Files

1. **main.py**
   - A terminal-based countdown timer.
   - Users input the deadline, and the remaining time is displayed in real-time.

2. **main_2.py**
   - A GUI-based countdown timer.
   - Features an intuitive interface for entering the deadline and a real-time countdown display.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `tkinter` (included with standard Python distributions)

## Usage

### Terminal Version

1. Run the script `main.py` in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Enter the deadline in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` when prompted.
3. The remaining time will be displayed continuously until the deadline is reached.

### GUI Version

1. Run the script `main_2.py` in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main_2.py
   ```
2. Enter the deadline in the input field in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
3. Click the "Start Countdown" button to begin the countdown.
